*The View from the Top* is a serious game about the cycle of anxiety. It is a single level platformer that demonstrates how anxiety is a circle that cannot be broken out of. 
In this repository are the GameMaker Studio project files for the game. The game .exe is downloadable through the releases tab, and is for Windows computers.
